   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to LightSim2Grid's documentation!
=========================================
LightSim2Grid is a simulator that can be used to accelerate the computation (leading to approximately the
same results) when using the `Grid2Op <https://github.com/Grid2Op/grid2op>`_ platform.

It is a port in c++ of some part of the excellent `PandaPower <https://github.com/e2nIEE/pandapower>`_ package
to make the computation faster.

As from version 0.3.0:

- `LightSimBackend` is available on windows (you don't need to compile KLU anymore)
- `LightSimBackend` is compatible with the "pickle" library, so you can use it with multiprocessing
  on windows, and with frameworks that requires it (for example ray rllib).

As from version 0.5.3:

- `lightsim2grid` is available on pypi, you can install it (on windows, macos and linux) with `pip install lighsim2grid`
