Change Log
===========

[TODO]
--------
- [refacto] have a structure in cpp for the buses
- [refacto] have the id_grid_to_solver and id_solver_to_grid etc. directly in the solver and NOT in the gridmodel.
- [refacto] put some method in the DataGeneric as well as some attribute (_status for example)
- support 3w trafo (as modeled in pandapower)
- improve speed by not performing internal checks 
  (keep check for boundaries and all for python API instead) [see `TODO DEBUG MODE` in c++ code]
- improve speed
- code parrallelism directly in the `Computer` and `SecurityAnalysisCPP` classes
- a mode to do both `Computer` and `SecurityAnalysisCPP`
- use the "multi slack hack" (see issue #50) for SecurityAnalysis or Computer for example
- code `helm` powerflow method
- interface with gridpack (to enforce q limits for example)
- maybe have a look at suitesparse "sliplu" tools ?
- easier building (get rid of the "make" part)

TODO: speed directly update the pv, pq, Sbus and Ybus part when updating the elements
      (less error prone and faster to recompute). Then what is passed to the solver 
      is "only" a "mask" of these data when null
TODO: https://github.com/haranjackson/NewtonKrylov for another type of algorithm ?
TODO HVDC in Jacobian (see pandapower)
TODO: in ContingencyAnalysisCpp: add back the `if(!ac_solver_used)` inside the  `remove_from_Ybus`
      in order to perform the "invertibility" check
TODO: in `main.cpp` check the returned policy of pybind11 and also the `py::call_guard<py::gil_scoped_release>()` stuff
TODO: a cpp class that is able to compute (DC powerflow) ContingencyAnalysis and TimeSeries using PTDF and LODF
TODO: integration test with pandapower (see `pandapower/contingency/contingency.py` and import `lightsim2grid_installed` and check it's True)

[0.10.3] 2025-03-xx
----------------------
- [FIXED] remove deprecated use of numpy<2 function in LightSimBackend
- [FIXED] the "copy.deepcopy" of a lightsim2grid backend does not crash anymore 
  (see issues #36 and #97)
- [FIXED] an issue that could lead to a "segfault" if the "runpf" method of
  `LightSimBackend` was called first with is_dc=True and then with is_dc=False
- [IMPROVED] compat with grid2op 1.11.0
- [IMPROVED] now test proper compilation on clang 20 (was limited to clang 18 before)

[0.10.2] 2025-03-07
----------------------
- [FIXED] an error when changing of bus one of the slack (did not trigger the 
  recompute of pv bus ids)
- [FIXED] an issue when turning off a generator: it was still declared as "slack"
  if it was one.
- [FIXED] could not disconnect a generator when it was a slack bus
- [FIXED] voltage was -1 instead of 0 for disconnected elements (load, generator, storage units etc.)
- [ADDED] an option in `LightSimBackend` automatically disconnect load and generators
  if they are not in the main connected component.
- [IMPROVED] refactoring of the c++ side container element to reduce
  code (for "one end" elements such as loads, generators, static generators and shunts)

[0.10.1] 2025-01-04
----------------------------
- [FIXED] some timings on the benchmarks were not measured at the right time
- [ADDED] more benchmarks especially for DC powerflow
- [ADDED] a `dcpf` function that can replace the pandapower `dcpf` interal function
- [IMPROVED] benchmark on the documentation
  (clarity of what is done)
- [IMPROVED] consistency of the names and measured times accross the different benchmarks

[0.10.0] 2024-12-17
-------------------
- [BREAKING] disconnected storage now raises errors if some power is produced / absorbed, when using legacy grid2op version,
  you can retrieve the previous behaviour by initializing the `LightSimBackend` with
  `backend = LightSimBackend(..., stop_if_storage_disco=False)`
- [BREAKING] with the new `detachment_is_allowed` feature in grid2op, the kwargs `stop_if_load_disco`,
  `stop_if_gen_disco` (and `stop_if_storage_disco`) are now optional. They are set up from the 
  call to `grid2op.make(...)` and are erased by the `allow_detachment` kwargs. In other words,
  you don't need to set `stop_if_load_disco`, `stop_if_gen_disco` or `stop_if_storage_disco`. It is 
  automatically set by `grid2op.make(..., allow_detachment=XXX)` to have the correct bahaviour.
- [FIXED] an issue with the storage units (when asking it to produce / consume 
  but deactivating them with the same action the grid did not diverge)
- [IMPROVED] add the grid2op "detachement" support (loads and generators are allowed
  to be disconnected from the grid)
- [ADDED] a kwargs `stop_if_storage_disco` to control (in legacy grid2op version) the behaviour 
  of the backend when a storage unit is disconnected.

[0.9.2.post2] 2024-11-29
--------------------------
- [FIXED] The attribute `can_output_theta` (of base `Backend` class)
  was not set to `True` if using the pypowsybl loader.
- [FIXED] the github CI to work properly on many linux buit image
- [IMPROVED] build on python 3.13

[0.9.2.post1] 2024-11-28
--------------------------
- [FIXED] There is still a bug with the pypowsybl 1.8.1 version with the 
  tap changer ratio (unconsistency between what needs to be done and the 
  actual documentation). The fix is to set the const variable `PP_BUG_RATIO_TAP_CHANGER`
  to be at least 1.9.0, otherwise results are wrong.
  
[0.9.2] 2024-10-18
--------------------------
- [ADDED] support loading a grid when everything is NOT on the same bus
  (`topo_vect` used to be wrong in this case). This is especially usefull
  for grid loaded with `pypowsybl`
- [ADDED] a file benchmarking the timings for running powerflow on different
  grid sizes.
- [UPDATED] urls to match the new repo location
- [UPDATED] urls to match new grid2op location

[0.9.1] 2024-09-30
--------------------------
- [FIXED] a bug due to wrong type (in a numpy array) for the element name which lead in turn 
  to a fail assertion (equality between two numpy arrays returning a bool and not an array)
- [FIXED] a bug when init a grid from pypowsybl: the wrong value was used for trafos `h` (double)
- [FIXED] a bug when init a grid from pypowsybl: wrong values for `_ls_to_orig` and `_orig_to_ls`
  was set (and later used)
- [FIXED] yet another bug when init a grid from pypowsybl: the voltage in kV (not in pu)
  could be set due to "wrong" labelling of the bus ids
- [FIXED] yet another bug when init a grid from pypowsybl: the ratio of the transformers 
  sent in lightsim2grid did not take into account the "`rated_u1` `rated_u2`" on both side 
  (only used on one side)
- [FIXED] yet another bug when init a grid from pypowsybl: the ratio of the transformers 
  sent in lightsim2grid did not take into account the ratio in the  `pypow_net.get_ratio_tap_changers()`
- [ADDED] a method for the `ContingencyAnalysisCPP` class that returns, for all contingencies
  in the contingency list, which will be simulated and which causes the grid to be disconnected.
- [ADDED] it is now possible to use "one substation" (voltage level) pypowsybl side is
  one substation in lightsim2grid.
- [IMPROVED] removing a weird `1j * h_` when initializing powerlines and transformers. This was 
  part of a pandapower "hack" which is not present anymore (see 
  https://github.com/Grid2Op/lightsim2grid/issues/88#issue-2443299039)

[0.9.0] 2024-07-29
--------------------------
- [BREAKING] installing pandapower lightsim2grid does not require anymore to install
  pandapower (you can initialize `GridModel` with pypowsybl or pandapower if you want). To make it both
  cleaner and clearer the function `lightsim2grid.gridmodel.init` has been removed.
  Please use `lightsim2grid.gridmodel.init_from_pandapower` or 
  `lightsim2grid.gridmodel.init_from_pypowsybl` from now on
- [BREAKING] the previous `gridmodel.get_ptdf()` function was wrongly labelled with the
  "solver" bus id and not the `gridmodel` bus id which could cause issue when it was computed 
  on some grid configuration. It has now been fixed (so the `gridmodel.get_ptdf` returns the
  proper things). If you want the previous behaviour, you need to use `gridmodel.get_ptdf_solver()`
- [BREAKING] similarly, `gridmodel.get_Ybus()`, `gridmodel.get_dcYbus()`, `gridmodel.get_Sbus()`
  and `gridmodel.get_dcSbus()` now return things in the `gridmodel` bus ordering. For the previous
  behaviour you can use `gridmodel.get_Ybus_solver()`, `gridmodel.get_dcYbus_solver()`,
  `gridmodel.get_Sbus_solver()` and `gridmodel.get_dcSbus_solver()`
- [BREAKING] the more rational logic above also extends to all the functions listed in the 
  table below:

===============================    ===================================================
Function with behaviour change      Name of the new function having the same behaviour
===============================    ===================================================
gridmodel.get_ptdf()                gridmodel.get_ptdf_solver()

gridmodel.get_dcYbus()              gridmodel.get_dcYbus_solver()
gridmodel.get_Sbus()                gridmodel.get_Sbus_solver()
gridmodel.get_dcSbus()              gridmodel.get_dcSbus_solver()
gridmodel.get_pv()                  gridmodel.get_pv_solver()

gridmodel.get_slack_weights()       gridmodel.get_slack_weights_solver()
gridmodel.get_V()                   gridmodel.get_V_solver()
gridmodel.get_Va()                  gridmodel.get_Va_solver()
gridmodel.get_Vm()                  gridmodel.get_Vm_solver()
gridmodel.get_J()                   gridmodel.get_J_solver()
gridmodel.get_Bf()                  gridmodel.get_Bf_solver()
===============================    ==================================================

- [FIXED] the `change_solver` in the `ContingencyAnalysis` did not work correctly.
  More specifically the solver type used might not be correct if changed which could 
  lead to wrong Ybus being passed to the solver.
- [FIXED] some compatibility mode with python `3.7`
- [FIXED] a bug when "turned off" generator were not PV (slack was 
  "turned off" when its target P was 0. But still the slack so ends up producing something...)
- [FIXED] (consistency with pandapower) when an intial powerflow is run
  to initialized an AC powerflow, the initial voltages are 1 pu (and 
  not `gridmodel.get_init_vm_pu()` as previously).
- [FIXED] `gridmodel.get_ptdf()` now have the 
  normal "gridmodel" bus id representation and not the "solver" bus ordering.
- [FIXED] `gridmodel.get_lodf()` issue wrong results in case of some
  topological modification
- [FIXED] calls to methods such as `gridmodel.get_pv` or `gridmodel.get_V` 
  or `gridmodel.get_Ybus` could lead to severe crashes (segmentation fault)
  on some (rare) cases. Now an exceptions should be thrown in these cases.
- [FIXED] basic backward compatibility is ensured and tested for legacy grid2op >= 0.9.1.post1
  Not all features are tested and only 1.x versions are tested 
  (ie 1.1 or 1.2 but not 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3 etc.) and only for python 3.11
- [FIXED] a bug when using `LightSimBackend` with some old (but not too old) grid2op
  versions.
- [FIXED] various compatibility bugs when using old grid2op versions.
- [ADDED] it is now possible to deactivate the support for shunts by 
  subclassing the LightSimBackend class and setting the `shunts_data_available`
  to `False`
- [IMPROVED] in the `ContingencyAnalysis` class, the underlying cpp model will now
  perform an initial powerflow.
- [IMPROVED] distributed wheels are now compiled (whenever possible) with numpy 2. 
  This makes them compatible with both numpy 1.x.y and numpy 2.z.t versions.
- [IMPROVED] tests are now performed when lightsim2grid is compiled with 
  the latest clang (18) and gcc (14) versions on the CI using python 3.11

[0.8.2.post1] 2024-04-xx
--------------------------
- [FIXED] a "forward compatibility" issue with grid2op 1.10.2
  (due to wrong usage of some internal classes when loading a pandapower grid)

[0.8.2] 2024-04-22
--------------------
- [FIXED] CI was broken after migration to artifact v4, set it back to v3 
  (and make the names of the folder clearer)
- [FIXED] CI when using latest pandapower version (2.14) which broke some previous tests
- [ADDED] the computation of the LODF (line outage distribution factor) in 
  lightsim2grid
- [ADDED] some convenience functions to retrieve in a vectorized way the 
  buses to which each elements of a given container is connected 
  (*eg* `gridmodel.get_lines().get_bus_from()`)
- [ADDED] more binaries (windows `arm64` and macos `arm64`)
- [IMPROVED] remove some compilation warnings for clang
- [IMPROVED] possibility to specify generator used as slack by its name when initializing
  from `pypowsybl`.
- [IMPROVED] removing some warnings when grid2op is not installed
  (it should not raise any warning as lightsim2grid does not require grid2op)

[0.8.1] 2024-03-26
--------------------
- [FIXED] a bug with shunts when `nb_busbar_per_sub` >= 2
- [FIXED] some bugs preventing backward compatibility
- [FIXED] an issue in the computation of gen_q when intialized with pypowsybl
  (some overflow cpp side leading to infinite number in gen_q)
- [FIXED] a bug in the "containers" cpp side (wrong bus was assigned)
  when elements was disconnected, which lead to wrong computations for 
  time series or contingency analysis.
- [FIXED] another bug in ContingencyAnalysis (cpp side) leading to wrong computation
  when a powerline was disconnected
- [FIXED] some broken imports when grid2op was not installed
- [FIXED] missing "typing_extension" as required when installation
- [ADDED] some information of compilation directly in the cpp module
- [ADDED] some information of compilation available in the python `compilation_options`
  module python side
- [ADDED] some convenient methods for `ContingencyAnalysis` python side (most 
  notably the possibility to initialize it from a `LightSimBackend` and to
  change the topology of the grid)
- [ADDED] a "reward" module in lightsim2grid with custom reward
  based on lightsim2grid.
- [ADDED] a class `N1ContingencyReward` that can leverage lightsim2grid to 
  assess the number of safe / unsafe N-1.
- [IMPROVED] time measurments in python and c++
- [IMPROVED] now test lightsim2grid with oldest grid2op version
- [IMPROVED] speed, by accelerating the reading back of the data (now read only once and then
  pointers are re used)
- [IMPROVED] c++ side avoid allocating memory (which allow to gain speed python side too)
- [IMPROVED] type hinting in `LightSimBackend` for all 'public' methods (most 
  notably the one used by grid2op)
- [IMPROVED] now the benchmarks are more verbose (detailing some compilation options)

[0.8.0] 2024-03-18
--------------------
- [BREAKING] now able to retrieve `dcSbus` with a dedicated method (and not with the old `get_Sbus`).
  If you previously used `gridmodel.get_Sbus()` to retrieve the Sbus used for DC powerflow, please use
  `gridmodel.get_dcSbus()` instead.
- [DEPRECATED] in the cpp class: the old `SecurityAnalysisCPP` has been renamed `ContingencyAnalysisCPP`
  (you should not import it, but it you do you can `from lightsim2grid.securityAnalysis import ContingencyAnalysisCPP` now)
- [DEPRECATED] in the cpp class: the old `Computers` has been renamed `TimeSerieCPP`
  (you should not import it, but it you do you can `from lightsim2grid.time_serie import TimeSerieCPP` now)
- [FIXED] now voltage is properly set to 0. when shunts are disconnected
- [FIXED] now voltage is properly set to 0. when storage units are disconnected
- [FIXED] a bug where non connected grid were not spotted in DC
- [FIXED] a bug when trying to set the slack for a non existing genererator
- [FIXED] a bug in init from pypowsybl when some object were disconnected. It raises
  an error (because they are not connected to a bus): now this function properly handles
  these cases.
- [FIXED] a bug leading to not propagate correctly the "compute_results" flag when the 
  environment was copied (for example)
- [FIXED] a bug where copying a lightsim2grid `GridModel` did not fully copy it
- [FIXED] a bug in the "topo_vect" comprehension cpp side (sometimes some buses 
  might not be activated / deactivated correctly)
- [FIXED] a bug when reading a grid initialize from pypowsybl (trafo names where put in place 
  of shunt names)
- [FIXED] read the docs was broken
- [FIXED] a bug when reading a grid from pandapower for multiple slacks when slack 
  are given by the "ext_grid" information.
- [FIXED] a bug in "gridmodel.assign_slack_to_most_connected()" that could throw an error if a 
  generator with "target_p" == 0. was connected to the most connected bus on the grid
- [FIXED] backward compat with "future" grid2op version with a 
  better way to copy `LightSimBackend`
- [ADDED] sets of methods to extract the main component of a grid and perform powerflow only on this
  one.
- [ADDED] possibility to set / retrieve the names of each elements of the grid.
- [ADDED] embed in the generator models the "non pv" behaviour. (TODO need to be able to change Q from python side)
- [ADDED] computation of PTPF (Power Transfer Distribution Factor) is now possible
- [ADDED] (not tested) support for more than 2 busbars per substation
- [ADDED] a timer to get the time spent in the gridmodel for the powerflow (env.backend.timer_gridmodel_xx_pf)
  which also include the time 
- [ADDED] support for more than 2 busbars per substation (requires grid2op >= 1.10.0)
- [ADDED] possibility to retrieve the bus id of the original iidm when initializing from pypowsybl 
  (`return_sub_id` kwargs). This is a "beta" feature and will be adressed in a better way
  in a near future.
- [ADDED] possibility to continue the grid2op 'step' when the solver converges but a load or a 
  generator is disconnected from the grid.
- [IMPROVED] now performing the new grid2op `create_test_suite` 
- [IMPROVED] now lightsim2grid properly throw `BackendError`
- [IMPROVED] clean ce cpp side by refactoring: making clearer the difference (linear) solver
  vs powerflow algorithm and move same type of files in the same directory. This change
  does not really affect python side at the moment (but will in future versions)
- [IMPROVED] CI to test on gcc 13 and clang 18 (latest versions to date)
- [IMPROVED] computation speed: grid is not read another time in some cases.
  For example, if load and generators do not change, then Sbus is not
  recomputed. Likewise, if the topology does not change, then the Ybus 
  is not recomputed either see https://github.com/Grid2Op/lightsim2grid/issues/72

[0.7.5.post1] 2024-03-14

  lightsim2grid to allow their installation if wheels are not provided.
- [IMPROVED] in the underlying cpp GridModel powerlines can now have 2
  different values for the `h` parameters (`h_or` and `h_ex`).

  contiguous non starting at 0 bus index

[0.7.3/4] 2023-08-24
--------------------
- [FIXED] a bug where, when you disconnect a load (or gen), the next action cannot be performed
  if it modifies the load (or gen), because you "cannot change the value of a disconnected load (or gen)"
- [FIXED] read-the-docs template is not compatible with latest sphinx version (7.0.0)
  see https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/issues/1463
- [IMPROVED] initialize the underlying "PandaPowerBackend" without numba
- [IMPROVED] grid2op import to be more compliant with renaming of uppercased file names
- [IMPROVED] decoupling of the PandapowerBackend class and the class "internally" used by LightSimBackend
  when loading the grid. This caused some issue, *eg* https://github.com/Grid2Op/grid2op/issues/508

[0.7.2] 2023-06-06
--------------------

- [FIXED] a bug in the DC comptuation: some "divergence" were not catched
- [FIXED] a bug in the "Computer" (cpp) class where the intial voltage could lead to generator not
  participating correctly to the voltage regulation (wrong output voltage level).
- [FIXED] a bug in the "set_bus" of shunt (wrong bus was assigned cpp side)
- [FIXED] an issue when slack bus is added from ext grid (wrong active power value - sign issue)
- [ADDED] support for the CKTSO linear solver (on linux), which is slightly faster than SparseLU, KLU and NICSLU
  (this requires a compilation from source)
- [ADDED] support for distributed slack bus in `LightSimBackend`
- [ADDED] support for "generator with p=0. do not participate in voltage regulation" in `LightSimBackend`
- [ADDED] support for the DC computation for "SecurityAnalysis" and "TimeSerie" modules
- [ADDED] support for DC powerline (in lightsim, they are still not handled in grid2op)
- [IMPROVED] now that multiple slacks is fully supported, the warnings when importing a grid with multiple slacks
  are irrelevant. They have been removed.
- [IMPROVED] the documentation on the "sovlers" part

[0.6.1.post1] 2022-02-02
-------------------------
- [FIXED] support for python3.7 (and add proper tests in CI)

[0.6.1] 2022-02-01
--------------------
- [BREAKING] the behaviour of the `newton_pf` function is not 
  consistent with pandapower default concerning distributed slack.
- [FIXED] an issue in the distributed slack case spotted by pandapower team 
  thanks to them (see https://github.com/e2nIEE/pandapower/pull/1455)
- [IMPROVED] lightsim2grid will now use the single slack algorithm if the 
  grids counts only one slack bus (performance increase)

[0.6.0] 2021-12-17
-------------------
- [BREAKING] change the interface of the `newton_pf` function to reflect pandapower change in their
  latest version (arguments `ref` has been added). You can still use the old `newton_pf` function, with the
  old signature by importing `newtonpf_old` instead or explicitly importing the new one by importing `newtonpf_new`
- [BREAKING] `SecurityAnalysis` now also returns the active flows when calling `security_analysis.get_flows()`
- [BREAKING] change the file names (python side) to be compliant with pep 8. You can no longer
  do things like `from lightsim2grid.LightSimBackend import LightSimBackend` change it to
  `from lightsim2grid import LightSimBackend` (preferred method)
- [BREAKING] change the file names (python side) to be compliant with pep 8. You can no longer
  do things like `from lightsim2grid.initGridModel import init` change it to
  `from lightsim2grid.gridmodel import init` (preferred method) (same for `GridModel` class)
- [FIXED] a bug that lead to the wrong computation of the dc powerflow in case of `sn_mva != 1.` and phase shifters.
- [FIXED] bug preventing to use the NICSLU linear solver in the `GridModel`
- [FIXED] compilation warnings on clang (missing virtual destructor, unused variables, etc.)
- [FIXED] a bug in the `SecurityAnalysisCPP`: when it diverges for some contingencies, the others were not simulated properly.
- [FIXED] `LightSimBackend` now contains members for `shunts` and `***_theta` as it does for the other quantities. This improves the consistency, but most importantly
  fixes some bugs when used in earlier grid2op versions
- [ADDED] possibility to compute the active flows using the `BaseMultiplePower` 
- [ADDED] possibility to change linear solver used when performing a DC solver
- [ADDED] possibility to make powerflow with distributed slack bus (only for newton raphson at the moment)

  https://github.com/chenxm1986/nicslu for more information. Support does not include multi threaded at the moment).
- [IMPROVED] minor performance improvements for the solvers based on Newton Raphson (faster filling of the Jacobian
  matrix after the first iteration)
